**Explanation

One of the easiest web chllanges because the answer is in the title. Robots.txt is a file that contains instructions to crawlers, which are used in indexing

**Solution

The initial website should look like this:

The flag isn't quite there yet, but it looks like the site does not want crawlers to access /1bb4c.html. So we van visit the site 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/1bb4c.html

and the flag is picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}
