**Explanation

The instructions require us to "break in" and the hints point to obfusication, meaning a code is purposely made complicated. Using developer tool to look around
the source code, a run-on formatted Javascript (line 10) with hex and "password" sits between the html codes. Upon further inspection, it also contains parts 
of the flag and this is what we need to deobfusicate to get the flag. 

**Solution

Just as the hint says, the Javascript needs to be deobfusicated so that it can be interpreted for the flag. By googling, I found this great tool: https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/
and used auto-decode which gave me the clean version of the verify() function which showed how the flag was structured. (The source code of the clean version is in func.js file  
in this folder). The function uses the "substring" method of Javascript, and shows what values should be in between 2 hex value of substrings. 

E.g. checkpass.substring(0x0, split * 0x2) == 'picoCTF{' --> This shows that the value of substring 0 and 8 (as split = 0x4) should be picoCTF{, so p = 1, { = 8

Because the verify() function does not put the flag in the correct order, now all we have to do it put them in the ascending substring value to get the flag
this gives us flag: picoCTF{not_this_again_ef49bf}. 
(Can also be double checked by using the input on the website, if the pop up is 'Password verified' the flag is correct!)
