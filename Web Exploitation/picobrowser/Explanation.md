**Explanation

User-agents are a part of header showing the type of browser and operating system the request has. Because the flag can be only access as "picobrowser", we
need to send a request with the user-agent as "picobrowser"

**Solution

Curl can be used here, with the following command:

curl -A "picobrowser" https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/28921/fla

and this returns the webpage with the flag (source code in result.html in the folder)

flag: picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_84f9c865}
